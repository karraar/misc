## Find the fist pair of numbers that add up to target_sum from Array/Seq/List
### Scala
[Code](src/main/scala/FindPair/FindPair.scala) runs show that Loop is faster than recursive.

### Python3
[Code](src/main/python/find_pairs.py) runs show that Loop is similar in performance to recursive, but Python does not support large recursive calls.
